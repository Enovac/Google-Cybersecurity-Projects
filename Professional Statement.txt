I am a dedicated and hardworking individual with a strong passion for cybersecurity. My main goal is to protect people and organizations from the threats posed by hackers and threat actors and to make a difference in the world. I am particularly interested in combating cybercrime and developing new ways to prevent it.

My journey into cybersecurity started when I was a child and got hacked while playing video games. This experience sparked my curiosity about how hacking works, so I began learning Python at a young age, focusing on basic concepts. Even though I didn’t understand everything at that time, I was determined to learn more about cybersecurity as it’s a fascinating field. I believe working in this field is more than just a job; it's a fun challenge where one gets to think about how to protect systems and identify vulnerabilities and to try to predict what the threat actors will try to exploit next and prevent them from succeeding.

I consider myself a quick learner who enjoys discovering new concepts and expanding my skill set. I also perform well under stress and have strong problem-solving abilities, which help me tackle challenges effectively. One day I hope to invent groundbreaking cybersecurity tools or techniques that make a significant difference in the world.

I strive to carry on the legacy of my grandfather, who was an accomplished IT engineer working for the United Nations and be remembered for my contributions in cybersecurity and to earn a master’s degree and a PhD in this field, continually learning and growing as I pursue my passion.
